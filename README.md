Identify Requirements:

- Then need to be able to place orders and actions

Plan & Design:
Systematic approach will be taken with a top-down implementation of the functions.

Build/Code:

- [ ] Build to be done concurrently with the Code of choice being Python.
- [ ] Accept funds.
- [ ] Withdraw funds

Test/Debug/Document:
Testing will be done parallely due to the limited number of functions.

Deploy:
Once application passes testing it can be deployed.
As of 11/17/2021 it has been deployed.
